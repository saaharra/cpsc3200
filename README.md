# cpsc3200

This just consists of OOP classes and projects. folders p1, p2, and p4 all use code reuse amongst each other
p1 is just the start of it
p2 starts to implement memory management, aka move semantics and deep copying
p4 starts to implement smart/unique pointers, alongside operator overloading and all of the neccesities that it needs to do so

folers p3 and p5 are implemented and have code reuse, p5 reuses code from p3.
p3 is the start of single inheritance. creating base class Fighter and then having infantry and turret inherit from the base class
p5 is the start of a simulated mulitple inheritance. there are two class hierarchies, one fighter hierarchy and the other is a guard hierarchy. 
this then leads into a corss product of both hierarchies
